<h1>Welcome to My GitHub Account!</h1>

Hello there! I'm a passionate PhD student in the field of Telecommunications and Signal Processing at the University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene (USTHB). 
This is my GitHub account where I share my projects and research related to Python programming, data hiding, steganography, deep learning, and audio processing for deep learning. 
Recently, my research work has been focused on data hiding using deep learning techniques.
